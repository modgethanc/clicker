an arduino-based speedclicker, controlled with a potentiometer. 

the LED only serves to monitor clicking rate, dimmed so it's less blinding. set the LED pin to 13 and use digitalWrite if you're using the onboard LED instead of an external one.

this was mostly made to win cookieclicker ( http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/ ) but is probably useful for all sorts of situations where whoever clicks the mouse most wins. this way, it'll save you some RSI and a few destroyed mice.
